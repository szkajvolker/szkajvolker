Hi there, I'm Istvan Szabo 👋

### 💻 Junior Frontend Developer 🎨

I am a passionate and motivated frontend developer from Hungary, with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
During my studies I also build several MERN stack projects, which helped me understand full application flows, CRUD operations, and error handling.
