Hi there, I'm Istvan Szabo 👋
Junior Frontend Developer from Hungary

I build clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications with a strong focus on modern technologies.
Through multiple MERN stack projects, I gained hands-on experience with full-stack applications flows, CRUD operations, and error handling.
